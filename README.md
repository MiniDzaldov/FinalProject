## Volunteer Matching Platform for Soldiers' Families

### Overview
The Volunteer Matching Platform for Soldiers' Families is a web-based application designed to connect volunteers with soldiers' families in need of assistance. This platform aims to streamline the process of matching volunteers' skills and availability with the specific needs of soldiers' families, thereby facilitating meaningful and impactful support during times of need.

### Background
The project was established in response to events on October 7th, which led to a war between Israel and Gaza. As a result, hundreds of thousands of Israeli men were drafted into reserve service, leaving their families and children behind. The project addresses the Israeli public who want to volunteer and take part in the war effort, even if not at the front lines. It serves as a mediator between volunteers and soldiers' families who need help, providing a platform for coordination and support during challenging times.
